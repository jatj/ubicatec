# UbicaTec API

This API allows Tecs&#x27; students to navigate throught the campus, rent books, order food, print documents and get help inside the Tec Campus Cuernavaca.

## Version 1.0.0

## Development
1. `npm run install`
1. `npm run build`
1. `npm run migrate`
1. `npm run start`

#### Grunt
If you want to use grunt while developing the API, run:
`grunt serve` this will:
1. Watch the ts files, recompile when changes
2. Watch the js files, restart the server when changes
Note: you will probably need to install grunt cli globally, `npm install -g grunt-cli` if you haven't already
